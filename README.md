# Tower of Hanoi â€“ using recurion in C

This program solves the Tower of Hanoi puzzle using recursion in the C programming language.

The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle that consists of:
- Three rods: Source (A), Helper (B), and Destination (C)
- N disks: All of different sizes, initially stacked on the source rod in decreasing order of size (largest at bottom)

 Objective is to;-
Move all the disks from Source rod (A) to Destination rod (C) using Helper rod (B), following these rules:

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. You can only move the top disk of a rod.
3. A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.
